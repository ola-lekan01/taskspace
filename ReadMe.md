# TaskSpace

The TaskSpace Application Backend is a comprehensive and robust backend solution built using Java 17, Spring Boot 3, Spring Security 6, PostgreSQL, and a Multi-Module Architecture. This backend powers a modern task management system, offering seamless task creation, organization, tracking, and notification functionalities. Leveraging OAuth2 implementation, it ensures secure authentication and authorization for users, along with modularization for efficient development and maintenance.

## Key Features

- Java 17: The backend is developed using the latest Java 17 features, ensuring high performance, improved memory management, and enhanced developer productivity.

- Spring Boot 3: Spring Boot 3 provides a strong foundation for building microservices with its streamlined development approach, embedded server, auto-configuration, and powerful dependency management.

- Spring Security 6: Implementing Spring Security 6 ensures robust security measures, including user authentication and authorization, role-based access control, and protection against common security vulnerabilities.

- PostgreSQL Database: The PostgreSQL database system is used to store and manage various data entities, such as user profiles, tasks, notifications, and more, ensuring data integrity and scalability.

- Multi-Module Architecture: The backend is structured into modular components, including User Management, Task Management, Notification, and Gateway modules. This approach promotes code reusability, maintainability, and easy scalability. 

- OAuth2 Implementation: The backend integrates OAuth2 for secure authentication and authorization. This allows users to use their existing accounts from Google, GitHub, or Facebook to log in, enhancing user convenience and security.

- RESTful APIs: The backend exposes a set of RESTful APIs that enable seamless communication between client applications and the server. These APIs provide endpoints for user management, task management, notifications, and more.

## Benefits

- Scalability: The modular architecture allows for easy scalability as new features can be added without disrupting existing components.

- Security: Spring Security 6 and OAuth2 ensure robust protection against unauthorized access, while PostgreSQL safeguards user data.

- Flexibility: Spring Boot's flexibility and Spring Security's customization capabilities enable the adaptation of the backend to various application requirements.

- Performance: Java 17's performance enhancements and Spring Boot's optimized configuration contribute to excellent runtime performance.

- Documentation: Comprehensive API documentation using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI ensures clear communication between frontend and backend developers and simplifies the integration process.

The TaskSpace Application Backend offers a modern, secure, and user-friendly backend solution for task management. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies and architectural principles, it empowers businesses and users to efficiently manage tasks, enhance productivity, and stay organized.***The API documentation is hosted [here]()***

## Getting Started

To get started with TaskSpace, you will need to clone this repository to your local machine and set up the necessary dependencies.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/{Your userName}/taskspace.git
    ```

2. Create PostgreSQL database

   ```bash
   psql> create database taskspace
   ```

3. Configure database username and password

     ```properties
   # src/main/resources/application.yml
     spring:
       datasource:
         url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/taskspace
         username: <YOUR_DB_USERNAME>
         password: <YOUR_DB_PASSWORD>

     ```

4. specify OAuth2 Provider ClientIds and ClientSecrets 
- This is optional if you're testing the app in localhost. A demo clientId and clientSecret is already specified.

- Set up the backend server:
   ```bash
     mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
